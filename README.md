### DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
#### 1.CLUSTERED BAR CHART :
![Sum Of Methane emissions (% change from 1990) 2006 To 2009 By Region](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8bf7c95-27af-4764-8ad7-27a72854fd0e)

    INTERPRETATION 
 In the clustered bar chart depicting changes in methane emissions (% change from 1990) 
across various regions, we can observe distinct patterns from 2006 to 2009. To facilitate a 
more comprehensive analysis, a slicer has been added to help us focus on specific regions.  

Looking at the data, we can discern significant variations in methane emissions: - 

- In the Asia Pacific region, emissions were 648 in 2006, decreased to 548 in 2007, rose to 590 in 2008, and finally reached 662 in 2009.  
- Europe experienced a different trend, with emissions starting at -34 in 2006, becoming -32 in 2007, improving to -19 in 2008, but then worsening to -47 in 2009. 
- The LAMEA (Latin America and the Middle East) region saw emissions starting at 182 in 2006, increasing to 207 in 2007, remaining stable at 208 in 2008, and decreasing to 180 in 2009.  
- In North America, emissions began at 38 in 2006, rose to 40 in 2007, further increased to 43 in 2008, but then decreased to 34 in 2009

#### 2.LINE AND STACKED COLUMN CHART :

    INTERPRETATION:
 The above chart shows have been constructed to visualize the sum of methane emissions (measured in kilotons of CO2 equivalent) for the years 2015 to 2020, focusing on 5 Top countries. To enhance the granularity of our analysis and allow for a detailed examination of emissions data on a country-by-country basis, a slicer has been integrated.
This slicer functionality provides a valuable tool for dissecting the emissions data, enabling us to delve into the specifics of each country's performance in managing methane emissions during the six-year period.  
The use of the slicer allows us to perform a comprehensive country-level analysis, which is crucial for pinpointing variations, trends, and outliers across different nations. This deeper examination can help identify both high-performing countries in terms of emissions reduction and those facing challenges. Such insights can inform policy decisions, global environmental strategies, and collaborative efforts to address methane emissions effectively.

    INTERPRETATION:
 The above table shows that we've represented the maximum methane emissions from the global energy sector over the years 2001 to 2008. This chart vividly showcases the highest percentages of emissions within this eight-year span.
The analysis of this data reveals a fluctuating pattern in the maximum methane emissions percentage:
- In 2001, the maximum percentage of methane emissions was recorded at 12.65%.
- In 2002, it slightly decreased to 12.25%.
- 2003 saw a minimal drop to 12.2%.
- The highest point within this period was observed in 2004, with a maximum of 12.68%.
- In 2005, the maximum percentage remained notably high at 12.57%.
- The year 2006 reached a peak of 12.64%.
- In 2007, methane emissions hit a maximum of 12.65%.

This analysis of peak methane emissions provides important insights into the variations within the global energy sector during these years. Understanding the years when emissions reached their highest levels is crucial for identifying trends and potential contributing factors, ultimately aiding in the development of strategies to mitigate and manage methane emissions effectively.

    INTERPRETATION:
In the 100% stacked bar chart, we have graphically represented the total sum of methane emissions in the energy sector, measured in thousand metric tons of CO2 equivalent, for various countries.      The data spans the years 2001 to 2006. Additionally, a zoom slider has been incorporated for each individual country, allowing for a detailed and interactive analysis. This chart provides a comprehensive view of how methane emissions are distributed across different countries within the energy sector during the specified six-year period. 

By presenting the data in a 100% stacked format, we can easily discern the contribution of each country to the overall emissions in this sector. 
The inclusion of the zoom slider enhances the analytical capabilities, enabling users to focus on specific countries of interest and examine their methane emission trends and variations in finer detail. This level of granularity is invaluable for identifying both high-emission countries and those successfully reducing emissions, thereby facilitating targeted interventions and policy decisions.

#### 5. TABLE :
